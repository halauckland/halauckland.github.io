For the first time in what feels like (and might actually be) months, I felt heard. I felt that I could share how I feel and that I could feel what I feel. With less fear of judgment &amp; with fewer preemptions of chastisement or questioning, I slowly felt more open to simply be. I felt safer. And, even through my tears, I felt I could breathe a bit easier, relax and let my guard down.
